<h1> Journal Entry Day 1</h1>
<p>So far in my CS Class, I've learned how to code and design a website. Overall, I've understood things quite well even though it's taken a lot of trial and error. My website still isn't perfect but I plan to keep working on it until it looks just like I wanted it to. I've learned about using different functions in Sublime Text like style, title, and other ways to design my page. I can adjust the color, positioning, background and even add images and embed pages within my website. I'm feeling quite good about everything I've learned, and though it takes a lot of adjustment, everything I've learned so far I have understood quite well. However, there are lots of things I'm working on. I still make small errors while coding, and aim to fix that with more practice. I also need to get more used to the functions and ways to use div. I'm really excited to see how my website turns out, and also add in animations like spinning flowers or changing things when I hover on it. However, small mistakes do get frustrating sometimes, and I have to use a lot of trial and error in order to get things right. When I don't understand something, I have to push through and try different things to find what works and what doesn't. My goals are to get my website to look the way I want it to, and to get more familiar with the functions</p>

<h1> Journal Entry Day 2</h1>
<p>So far in my CS Class, we've been working on improving and designing our websites. Though everything has been a gradual process, I've learned a lot over the course of the past few days. We will also be working on a project for our grandparents and I've started coming up with ideas for it. I've gotten a lot more familiar with functions in Sublime Text like style, title and others. However, I often get stuck on certain parts of coding that I have trouble working through. I usually use resources like the cheat sheet but that won't always work either. I try to use as much trial and error as possible. I also write things down in my notes that I don't want to forget while I'm coding, so I won't have to go back to it as much.

<h1>Journal Entry Day 3</h1>
<p>this week I learned about functions. Essentially, functions are a group of actions that you can call on whenever you want. I’m using them to make an animation of surprised pikachu when I click on the screen. It was pretty easy for me to understand the role of a function and what each piece of coding does. However, this was a little harder in the last bit, where I had to code the command to retrieve the image of pikachu and place it. After much trial and error, I finally got it, I did something for the first time in coding which was that I used websites and videos to help me when I got stuck. They were all so helpful and I will definitely use them more in the future. All in all, I think I understand my website a lot more this week, and I understand the language and how it relates to the different aspects of my website. Because of this, I’m better able to find what I did wrong when I make a mistake. Even though I often mess up on Amal things like forgetting a semicolon or inequality sign, it’s still helpful that I can find and correct it</p>

<h1>Journal Entry Day 4</h1>
<p>For this week in my CS Class, I made plenty of updates to my website and revamped its entire look. It's now white with pink roses and is centered by title on a beige square background. But most importantly, I made the website a lot more cohesive. This was also one of the key things I learned this week. I learned how to use the a and href functions in order to connect all my website pages to each other. Before, I had many index pages for different pages such as the journals, projects, and project 1. Now, I have it all connected into one website. This is a lot more efficient and cohesive than what I have before. Overall, something I need to work on is functions and javascript in general. I still need to work on understanding variables and their purpose, as well as how they get implemented. I think I will understand this more as class goes on. I will also continue to use online sources to help me, as they have been very helpful so far.

<h1>Journal Entry 5</h1>
<p>Today in my CS Class, I worked on designing my Holiday Playlist. Its a project where I make a digital calendar, and when you click on each day for the month of december, it takes you to a different song, so you have a song for all 31 days. So far, I've planned out the basics of how i want to create this calendar. I am planning to create 31 separate divs that each link to a spotify link. I then style the blocks to make it look how I want to. I then use a function to cerate multiple blocks over again. This i believe will be a repeat functionIn thinking the background could be a dark green or a black, and the clanedar days could be a lighter color. I also worked on my how it works presentation for how it works, and im thinking of doing cryptocurrency. Its short but quite concise.</p>

<h1>Journal Entry 6</h1>
<p>This week, we started a project based on creating interactive data representations. One of the ideas that Hannah and I had were to create a chart that displays all of our friends and their astrological sign. We started in class by making a google doc and listing all the astrological signs, as well as listing all our friends we knew birthdays of. We then organized all of our friends into categories, each color coded. This gave us a pretty good idea of the kind of data we have, and how to represent it. Even though we havent started sketching out data representation yet, were thinking of making a sort of circle or pie chart that lists everyone. Each sign would be color coded. So far, weve experimented with the javascript we could do, such as adding animations or click functions. It might take some time but we could make a very visually appealing data representation! </p>
