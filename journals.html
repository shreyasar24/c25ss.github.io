<h1> Journal Entry Day 1</h1>
<p>So far in my CS Class, I've learned how to code and design a website. Overall, I've understood things quite well even though it's taken a lot of trial and error. My website still isn't perfect but I plan to keep working on it until it looks just like I wanted it to. I've learned about using different functions in Sublime Text like style, title, and other ways to design my page. I can adjust the color, positioning, background and even add images and embed pages within my website. I'm feeling quite good about everything I've learned, and though it takes a lot of adjustment, everything I've learned so far I have understood quite well. However, there are lots of things I'm working on. I still make small errors while coding, and aim to fix that with more practice. I also need to get more used to the functions and ways to use div. I'm really excited to see how my website turns out, and also add in animations like spinning flowers or changing things when I hover on it. However, small mistakes do get frustrating sometimes, and I have to use a lot of trial and error in order to get things right. When I don't understand something, I have to push through and try different things to find what works and what doesn't. My goals are to get my website to look the way I want it to, and to get more familiar with the functions</p>

<h1> Journal Entry Day 2</h1>
<p>So far in my CS Class, we've been working on improving and designing our websites. Though everything has been a gradual process, I've learned a lot over the course of the past few days. We will also be working on a project for our grandparents and I've started coming up with ideas for it. I've gotten a lot more familiar with functions in Sublime Text like style, title and others. However, I often get stuck on certain parts of coding that I have trouble working through. I usually use resources like the cheat sheet but that won't always work either. I try to use as much trial and error as possible. I also write things down in my notes that I don't want to forget while I'm coding, so I won't have to go back to it as much.

<h1>Journal Entry Day 3</h1>
<p>this week I learned about functions. Essentially, functions are a group of actions that you can call on whenever you want. I’m using them to make an animation of surprised pikachu when I click on the screen. It was pretty easy for me to understand the role of a function and what each piece of coding does. However, this was a little harder in the last bit, where I had to code the command to retrieve the image of pikachu and place it. After much trial and error, I finally got it, I did something for the first time in coding which was that I used websites and videos to help me when I got stuck. They were all so helpful and I will definitely use them more in the future. All in all, I think I understand my website a lot more this week, and I understand the language and how it relates to the different aspects of my website. Because of this, I’m better able to find what I did wrong when I make a mistake. Even though I often mess up on Amal things like forgetting a semicolon or inequality sign, it’s still helpful that I can find and correct it</p>
